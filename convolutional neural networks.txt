
CS 231 Convolutional Neural Networks for visual Recognition:


In the article above the author has emphasized about ConvNet layers and ConvNet Architecutures.

In the first part of the article he introduces a newer concept of ConvNet architecture.
According to the author, the 3 main types of layers to build ConvNet architectures are again:
  a) Convolutional Layer,
  b) Pooling Layer
  c) fully-connected layer.

he further gives couple of example of ConvNet architecture where the CIFAR -10 classification has the architecture (INPUT -CONV-RELU-POOL-FC)

in summary, "a ConvNet architecture is in the simplest case a list of layers that transform the image volume into an output volume".
Also, according to the author, each layer may or may not have parameters and hyperparameters.

	In the second half of the article, the author introduces another new concept of "parameter sharing".
As per the author parameter sharing is used in convolutional layers to control number of parameters.
    We can dramatically reduce the number of parameters by making one reasonable assumption:
"That if one feature is useful to compute at some spatial position (x,y), then it should also be useful to compute at a different position (x2,y2)"
